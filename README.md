# Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka and Spring 

## Architecture Overview

### Producer Application
A Spring Boot application that sends serialized messages (in Avro format) to a Kafka topic.
Utilizes the KafkaAvroSerializer to serialize data based on an Avro schema.

### Consumer Application
A Spring Boot application that consumes messages from the Kafka topic, deserializes them using Avro, and processes the data.
Utilizes KafkaAvroDeserializer to deserialize the data into a strongly typed object.

### Kafka
Acts as the message broker that facilitates communication between the producer and consumer.

### Schema Registry
A service provided by Confluent that stores Avro schemas and ensures the compatibility of data between the producer and consumer.

### Docker
The Kafka broker, Zookeeper, Schema Registry, and both Spring Boot applications (producer and consumer) are containerized using Docker to ensure easy deployment and environment parity across development, staging, and production.
